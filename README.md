## Cross Validation und Grid Search

I used the dataset from Commeo and Osmancik Rice Dataset (see https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/). A total of 3810 images of rice grains were taken for the two species and processed. Conclusions were drawn about characteristics: For each rice grain, 7 morphological characters were obtained.

Dataset description: Rice_Cammeo_Osmancik.xlsx -> 3810 rows, 7 columns.
